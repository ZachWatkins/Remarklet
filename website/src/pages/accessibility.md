# Accessibility

This statement was last updated on May 11, 2025.

## Accessibility statement

I, Zachary Watkins, am working to make this website, Remarklet (https://remarklet.com), accessible to people with disabilities. I am using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 specification as a framework for identifying and resolving accessibility issues. You can find the guidelines at [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

## What is web accessibility?

An accessible site allows visitors with disabilities to browse the site with the same or a similar level of ease and enjoyment as other visitors. This can be achieved with the capabilities of the system on which the site is operating, and through assistive technologies.

## Accessibility adjustments on this site

I have adapted this site in accordance with WCAG 2.1 guidelines, and have made the site accessible to the level of AA. This site's contents have been adapted to work with assistive technologies, such as screen readers and keyboard use. As part of this effort, I have also:

1. Used an accessibility tool to find and fix potential accessibility issues
2. Set the language of the site
3. Set the content order of the site’s pages
4. Defined clear heading structures on all of the site’s pages
5. Added alternative text to images
6. Implemented color combinations that meet the required color contrast
7. Reduced the use of motion on the site
8. Ensured all videos, audio, and files on the site are accessible
