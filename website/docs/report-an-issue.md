# Report an Issue

We use GitHub to track [issues](https://github.com/ZachWatkins/Remarklet/issues) so if you find one please report it there. Some issues may be beyond the scope of this library to resolve. Issues that are out of scope are documented in a GitHub Discussion here: [Known issues not in scope](https://github.com/ZachWatkins/Remarklet/discussions/100).
