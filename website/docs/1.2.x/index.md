# Introduction

Have you ever wanted to quickly edit a web page for making high fidelity mockups of minor changes without diving into the code? Remarklet can help with that! You can [check out the CodePen demo](https://codepen.io/zw/full/azbEBKp) and see how it works.

Remarklet can be used by developers, designers, product managers, and anyone else who needs to make small quick edits to web pages on any device. It provides a simple way to modify text, drag and resize elements, and even hide elements on the page. You can also persist your changes in local storage and automatically restore them later.

And if you just want to use it to rearrange the UI for your favorite web tools, you can do that too!

If this sounds like something you would find useful, read on to learn how to install and use Remarklet.
