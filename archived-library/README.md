Visual editor app that makes modifying and commenting on web pages remarkably easy!

I built this plugin in 2014 to make it easier for my clients to communicate changes they wanted made to their website.

This JavaScript application is built with jQuery and jQuery UI and will allow you to rapidly prototype web site changes and more easily communicate web site revisions with others.

If you enjoyed using this tool, I would appreciate hearing from you! zwatkins.it@gmail.com
