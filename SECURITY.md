# Security

The only completely secure system is the one that doesn't exist in the first place. Having said that, I take the security of this project very seriously.

Therefore, please disclose potential security issues (including steps to recreate the issue) by email to zwatkins.it@gmail.com. I strive (not guarantee) to provide an initial assessment of security reports within 48 hours and if warranted will begin work on a patch within 2 weeks (also, feel free to contribute a fix for the issue).

## Notice

Even though I give no warranties or guarantees to the security of this repository (see [LICENSE](https://github.com/zachwatkins/remarklet/blob/main/LICENSE.md)), I will do my best to respond to security issues as quickly as possible.

## Supported Versions

The latest minor and major versions are supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability with the project please send an email to zwatkins.it@gmail.com with [SECURITY] at the beginning of the subject line.

When a vulnerability is found, I will notify users in [Discussions](https://github.com/zachwatkins/remarklet/discussions).

## Contributing to Security

I welcome pull requests to improve security as long as your pull request description **does not** include steps to recreate the security exploit.
